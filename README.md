> This repository implements a three-stage hybrid system for detecting WPA3 downgrade attacks.

> This repository contains the source code, scripts, and instructions for replicating the results from the paper:
"A Machine Learning Approach for Detecting WPA3 Downgrade Attacks in Next-Generation Wi-Fi Systems"

> The study proposes a Machine Learning-based approach (MFST-DAD) for detecting downgrade attacks in WPA3 networks.
 The model uses adaptive feature selection, thresholding, and real-time classification to secure next-generation Wi-Fi systems. 
The method is evaluated using aspecially generated dataset and achieves up to 99.8% detection accuracy.

> This repository supports downgrade attack detection based on CSV inputs.  
> It is structured for clarity, and all stages are modular. Make sure to update file paths as needed.
